Linear Regression in Machine Learning

Definition:  
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more independent variables.

1. Linear Regression Equation

The relationship is modeled as:

y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε

Where:
- y: Predicted output (dependent variable)
- β₀: Intercept (constant term)
- β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ: Coefficients (weights) of the features
- x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ: Input features (independent variables)
- ε: Error term (residuals)

2. Assumptions of Linear Regression
1. Linearity: The relationship between predictors and response is linear.
2. Independence: Observations are independent.
3. Homoscedasticity: Residuals have constant variance.
4. Normality: Residuals are normally distributed.

3. Cost Function

Minimize the difference between predicted and actual values using Mean Squared Error (MSE):

MSE = (1/n) * Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²

Where:
- yᵢ: Actual value
- ŷᵢ: Predicted value
- n: Number of observations

4. Derivation of Coefficients

Find coefficients (β) using the Normal Equation:

β = (XᵀX)⁻¹Xᵀy

Where:
- X: Input features matrix
- y: Actual outputs vector

5. Evaluation Metrics

R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained by the independent variables:

R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)

Where:
- SS_res = Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)² (Residual sum of squares)
- SS_tot = Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)² (Total sum of squares)

6. Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
- Simple to implement and interpret.
- Efficient for linearly separable data.

Disadvantages:
- Assumes linearity, which may not always hold.
- Sensitive to outliers.

Conclusion

Linear regression is a foundational technique in machine learning, providing insights into variable relationships. Its equations, assumptions, and applications facilitate effective predictive modeling.
